Anxiety Management Techniques

Deep Breathing:
Practice the 4-7-8 breathing technique: Breathe in for 4 seconds, hold for 7 seconds, exhale for 8 seconds. This activates your parasympathetic nervous system and helps calm anxiety.

Grounding Exercises:
Use the 5-4-3-2-1 technique when feeling anxious:
- Name 5 things you can see
- Name 4 things you can touch
- Name 3 things you can hear
- Name 2 things you can smell
- Name 1 thing you can taste

Progressive Muscle Relaxation:
Tense and relax each muscle group in your body, starting from your toes and moving up to your head. Hold tension for 5 seconds, then release for 10 seconds.

Cognitive Restructuring:
When anxious thoughts arise, ask yourself:
- Is this thought based on facts or feelings?
- What evidence do I have for and against this thought?
- What would I tell a friend in this situation?

Physical Exercise:
Regular physical activity reduces anxiety by releasing endorphins and reducing stress hormones. Even a 10-minute walk can help.

Limit Caffeine and Alcohol:
Both substances can increase anxiety symptoms. Consider reducing intake or switching to decaf options.

When to Seek Professional Help:
If anxiety is interfering with daily activities, relationships, or work, consider speaking with a mental health professional.
