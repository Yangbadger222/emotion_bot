Depression Support and Coping Strategies

Understanding Depression:
Depression is a medical condition, not a weakness. It affects your thoughts, feelings, and physical health. Recovery is possible with proper support and treatment.

Daily Self-Care:
- Maintain a regular sleep schedule (7-9 hours)
- Eat nutritious meals at regular times
- Take a shower or bath daily
- Get sunlight exposure, especially in the morning
- Engage in gentle movement or stretching

Behavioral Activation:
Start with small, achievable tasks:
- Make your bed in the morning
- Take a 5-minute walk
- Connect with one person (call, text, or in-person)
- Do one enjoyable activity, even if you don't feel like it

Challenge Negative Thoughts:
Depression often creates negative thinking patterns. Ask yourself:
- Am I thinking in all-or-nothing terms?
- Am I predicting the worst outcome?
- Am I discounting positive experiences?
- What's a more balanced way to look at this?

Social Connection:
Even when you don't feel like it, try to:
- Reach out to trusted friends or family
- Join a support group (online or in-person)
- Volunteer for a cause you care about
- Spend time with pets

Crisis Resources:
If you're having thoughts of self-harm or suicide:
- Call 988 (Suicide & Crisis Lifeline) in the US
- Text "HELLO" to 741741 (Crisis Text Line)
- Go to your nearest emergency room
- Call emergency services (911)

Professional Treatment:
Consider therapy (CBT, IPT) and/or medication. Both have strong evidence for treating depression. Don't hesitate to reach out to a mental health professional.
